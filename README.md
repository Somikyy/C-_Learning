# C++ Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my programming learning repository! I'm currently expanding my programming skills by learning **C++**, building upon my existing knowledge of **C** programming.

## About Me 👨‍💻

I'm a programmer who has experience with **C** programming, including basic functions and algorithms. Now I'm taking the next step to learn **C++** to expand my programming toolkit and explore object-oriented programming concepts.

## Learning Goals 🎯

- [ ] Master C++ syntax and features
- [ ] Understand object-oriented programming concepts
- [ ] Learn C++ standard library
- [ ] Practice with data structures and algorithms in C++
- [ ] Build practical projects using C++

## Current Progress 📈

### C++ Basics
- ✅ Basic I/O operations (`std::cout`, `std::cin`)
- ✅ Variable declarations and data types
- ✅ String handling with `std::string`
- 🔄 Learning more advanced C++ features...

### C Knowledge (Previous Experience)
- ✅ Basic C syntax and functions
- ✅ Fundamental algorithms
- ✅ Memory management basics
- ✅ Data structures in C

## Projects & Examples 💻

### Hello World Program
A simple C++ program demonstrating basic output and variable usage:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    double height = 1.75;
    std::string name = "Kirill";

    std::cout << "I'm " << age << " years old" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "My height is " << height << " meters" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "My name is " << name << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

### C++ Programs
```bash
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
./program_name
```

### C Programs
```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
./program_name
```
